        "1) It's hard to break anything permanently. If you mess this up badly enough, close the tab, reopen the notebook, and you'll be back to the starting place. Feel free to tinker and try stuff. It's low-stakes!\n",
        "\n",
        "2) If you've done some work and you're part-way to something you're trying to do, but want to experiment - make a copy of the notebook (\"File\" --> \"Save a Copy in Drive\") and mess around in the copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) A Jupyter notebook like this has alternating blocks: \"Text\" blocks, like this one, which don't contain any programming, just explanation, and \"Code\" blocks with little pieces of Python code that you can execute a block at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) In a \"Code\" block, lines beginning with \"#\" are comments - they contain text that won't be parsed as programming, and you can include regular text in those lines. I use them for commentary/explanation. You can also use them for troubleshooting - sometimes when you're trying to get things to work you'll want to mess around with including a command or code block, or removing it. Adding or removing a \"#\" is a really fast way to do that. There's a really basic code block below:"
